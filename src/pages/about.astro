    <h1>A bit about us</h1>
    <h3>Est. Melbourne 2015</h3>
    <p>
      In June 2015 with an idea, budget and unlimited coffee the team
      couldn’t find a development partner to help build their first website.
      Searching high and low they found some options which promised the
      world with matching price tags and others cheaper than lunch which
      had a bad taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long search the team met some like-minded individuals and set
      off to build a website together. Shocked with the level of
      communication and quality of the finished website the two teams decided
      to join together and create Tigmo.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a lounge room in South Yarra to an office in Richmond, the team
      have successfully completed websites for a range of small and large
      clients including global product distributors, schools and government
      funded organisations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our focus is on growth and improvement, not just for ourselves but for
      our clients as well. We love to get to know our clients and their
      companies and are passionate about building high quality technology
      while going on the big adventure we call business together.
